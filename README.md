# Employee-Dashboard Generator

## Description

This application accepts user input about their team of employees, and generates a ready-to-go, styled HTML file that displays each team member, their roles, ids,
emails, and a property specific to their role.

There is also a sample HTML file generated in the sampleHTMLfile/ folder of this repo.
